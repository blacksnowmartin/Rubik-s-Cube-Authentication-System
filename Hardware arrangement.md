Hardware Arrangement:
Mounting Color Sensors:

Attach color sensors to each face of the Rubik's Cube.
Ensure sensors are evenly distributed and aligned with each face.
Use adhesive or a custom mount to secure sensors without affecting the cube's functionality.
Wiring:

Connect the color sensors to the microcontroller (e.g., Arduino).
Organize the wiring to minimize interference and maintain a clean appearance.
Use color-coded wires for clarity.
Microcontroller Placement:

Position the microcontroller in a central or discreet location.
Consider integrating the microcontroller into a protective casing to prevent damage.
Power Supply:

Provide a stable power supply for both the microcontroller and color sensors.
Consider using rechargeable batteries or an external power source, depending on the project's requirements.
Integration with Cube Mechanics:

Ensure the color sensors do not obstruct the cube's movement.
Test the cube's functionality after attaching the sensors to confirm it can still be manipulated easily.
Enclosure (Optional):

Consider enclosing the entire system in a transparent case for protection.
This can showcase the inner workings of the system while protecting it from external elements.
User Interaction:
Indicator Lights (Optional):

Integrate indicator lights on the cube or near the color sensors.
Lights can provide feedback on successful authentication or indicate when the system is active.
User Instructions:

Include clear instructions for users on how to interact with the Rubik's Cube.
Provide information on setting up the passcode and troubleshooting.
Additional Features (Optional):

Implement additional features such as audio feedback or a display screen.
Consider user preferences and accessibility needs.
Testing:
Calibration:

Calibrate the color sensors to account for variations in lighting conditions.
Ensure the system remains accurate under different lighting scenarios.
User Testing:

Conduct thorough user testing to identify any usability issues.
Gather feedback on the arrangement and adjust if necessary.
