Software Components:
Color Recognition Algorithm:

Develop an algorithm to recognize the colors sensed by each sensor.
Map the color information to specific cubelet locations.
Passcode Generation:

Decide on a specific Rubik's Cube configuration as the passcode.
Map the passcode to a specific arrangement of colors on the cube.
Authentication Logic:

Implement authentication logic on the microcontroller.
Compare the sensed colors to the stored passcode.
